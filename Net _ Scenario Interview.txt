/.Net : Scenario Interview


Question: First one is an api and you were consuming it for data, second one need to pull data from different system[db call], and then you have your own data base that’s where all these data is gonna sit down, these are like 3 different systems.
OR 
Question: First part is : You have an api(like your3rd party micro service), which is giving you some set of data, then in second part you have to read some data base also, then you have to combine all these data and that’s what you were gonna use it in your application, I need to do this periodically and I need to refresh the data here, 

Question: What are your design considerations, how will you go ahead and do it?
Based on the scenario you provided, where you need to periodically load data from both an external API and a database, combine the data, and refresh it in your application, and given that you are building a console application, here are the key design considerations and steps you should take to implement this solution:

**** Design Considerations
1. Data Loading Frequency:
Since you need to refresh the data periodically, one of the first considerations is how often the data should be fetched from the API and the database.
Consider the business requirements—whether the data should be refreshed every hour, daily, or at custom intervals. This will dictate your scheduling mechanism.
Decision: Use a background service (like IHostedService in .NET Core/8) or a task scheduler (such as Hangfire or Quartz.NET) to periodically invoke the data loading operation.

2. Data Aggregation:
You will need to combine the data fetched from both the external API and the database.
Consider data formats and the process of merging them. For instance, you may have to handle different data types (e.g., JSON from the API and SQL results from the database) and ensure the data is transformed into a unified format for use in your application.
Decision: Implement data aggregation logic that first fetches the data from the API and database and then merges it into a structure that fits your application's needs. You might use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) or domain models to represent the combined data.

3. Error Handling:
Since you're combining data from two different sources, you need robust error handling to deal with issues such as:
API unavailability or data format issues.
Database connection issues or query failures.
Data mismatches or corruption when combining data.
Decision: Implement retry mechanisms for the API and database calls, log errors, and ensure graceful degradation. For example, if the API fails, try fetching it again or use cached data, and if the database fails, log the issue and decide whether to continue without it.

4. Data Storage or Usage:
Decide what happens after the data is combined. Is it temporarily stored in-memory, or is it persisted back to the database or some other storage (e.g., file system, NoSQL database)?
If the data is critical and used across the application, you may need to persist the combined data to a database or in-memory cache for fast access.
Decision: If the data needs to be persistent, store the combined result in a database or cache (such as Redis). If it's for one-time or short-term use, consider keeping it in-memory in the application.

5. Scalability:
Consider the potential volume of data being fetched from both the API and the database. If you're processing large datasets, think about pagination or batching for API responses to prevent memory overload or timeouts.
Also, consider parallelizing tasks (e.g., fetching the API and the database concurrently) to improve performance.
Decision: Use async calls to fetch data concurrently, handle pagination, and implement batch processing if necessary to handle large data volumes efficiently.

6. Concurrency Management:
Since this is a console application that might run in the background, it’s important to manage concurrency and ensure that the same data isn’t being refreshed multiple times simultaneously (e.g., if the scheduled job is delayed and a new job starts before the previous one finishes).
Decision: Implement a locking mechanism (e.g., SemaphoreSlim or a distributed lock if you're dealing with multiple instances) to ensure that only one data refresh process runs at a time.

--------

Yes, it could be a console application—but let's break it down further based on the context of what you're building.

*** PART 1: 
1. Console Application as a Background Service:
In the scenario you described, if you're using a console application to periodically pull data from a third-party API and a database, then combine and refresh the data, you're essentially building a background data processing service.
The console application can be configured to run as a standalone worker that executes periodic tasks using background jobs. It would typically not interact with a user directly, but would instead run continuously, handling the periodic data refreshes in the background.

=> How It Would Work:
You can use IHostedService in .NET 8 to create background tasks within a console app, which is the most common pattern for handling periodic jobs in a console application.

In this case, your console application will:

Periodically fetch data from the third-party API and the database.
Combine and process the data.
Store or cache the processed data for later use (e.g., using MemoryCache or DistributedCache).
Structure of a Console Application for Data Refresh:

***** 1.1 Program.cs (Main Entry Point): The Program.cs would configure the background service that runs periodically to refresh data.

Example: 
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using System;

class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Setup and start the host
        CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();
    }

    public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
        Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
            .ConfigureServices((hostContext, services) =>
            {
                services.AddHostedService<DataRefreshService>(); // Registering the background job
                services.AddSingleton<IDataService, DataService>(); // Your service that handles data fetching and processing
                services.AddLogging();
            });
}

***** 1.2. DataRefreshService (Background Job Logic): The background service (DataRefreshService) handles the periodic task of fetching, processing, and storing data.

Example : 

using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class DataRefreshService : BackgroundService
{
    private readonly IDataService _dataService;
    private readonly ILogger<DataRefreshService> _logger;

    public DataRefreshService(IDataService dataService, ILogger<DataRefreshService> logger)
    {
        _dataService = dataService;
        _logger = logger;
    }

    protected override async Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
    {
        while (!stoppingToken.IsCancellationRequested)
        {
            try
            {
                // Fetch data from API and DB
                var apiData = await _dataService.FetchApiDataAsync();
                var dbData = await _dataService.FetchDbDataAsync();
                var combinedData = _dataService.CombineData(apiData, dbData);

                // Cache or store the combined data
                await _dataService.StoreDataAsync(combinedData);

                _logger.LogInformation("Data refresh completed successfully at: {time}", DateTimeOffset.Now);
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                _logger.LogError(ex, "Error during data refresh.");
            }

            // Wait for the next refresh (e.g., every 10 minutes)
            await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10), stoppingToken);
        }
    }
}
****IMP POINTS:

The class DataRefreshService inherits from BackgroundService, which is part of the Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting namespace. The BackgroundService base class is designed for services that run in the background, typically long-running tasks like polling, data processing, or cleanup.
The core functionality of this service is implemented inside the ExecuteAsync method, which overrides the BackgroundService's ExecuteAsync method.

***ExecuteAsync Method:
=> Cancellation Token:
The stoppingToken is passed to the method to gracefully handle cancellation of the service when the application shuts down or the service is stopped. The loop continues running as long as stoppingToken.IsCancellationRequested is false.

Data Fetching:
Inside the while loop, it first attempts to fetch data:
await _dataService.FetchApiDataAsync() fetches data from an API.
await _dataService.FetchDbDataAsync() fetches data from a database.
Both results are then combined using _dataService.CombineData(apiData, dbData).

=> Data Storing:
After the data is combined, it is stored via await _dataService.StoreDataAsync(combinedData), which presumably caches or stores the data in a persistence layer.

=> Logging:
If the data refresh is successful, a log entry is created using _logger.LogInformation(), including the timestamp.
If any error occurs during the process (e.g., API call fails, DB call fails, etc.), the exception is caught, and an error message is logged using _logger.LogError(ex, "Error during data refresh.").

=> Delay Between Refreshes:
The Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10), stoppingToken) introduces a delay of 10 minutes between each data refresh. This ensures the background service doesn't keep running continuously without pause, but instead waits for the next scheduled refresh.
The stoppingToken is passed to Task.Delay() to handle cancellation if the service is requested to stop during the delay.

=> Cancellation Handling:
The while loop checks the stoppingToken.IsCancellationRequested to see if the service should stop. If it's true (indicating cancellation), the loop exits, and the background service terminates.
This graceful cancellation ensures that the background task is not forced to exit abruptly and can finish its current cycle properly before terminating.

****Key Points:
Background Service: The DataRefreshService runs in the background, executing indefinitely at regular intervals (every 10 minutes in this case).
Periodic Task: The service fetches data from an API and a database, combines it, stores it, and then waits 10 minutes before repeating the process.
Error Handling: The service includes robust error handling by logging any exceptions that occur during the data fetching or storing process.
Graceful Shutdown: The service supports graceful cancellation via CancellationToken, ensuring it stops properly when the application is shutting down or when requested.

***** 1.3. DataService (Data Fetching & Processing): This would be the service responsible for fetching data from the API, reading from the database, combining the data, and then storing or caching the result.

Example : 

public interface IDataService
{
    Task<List<ApiData>> FetchApiDataAsync();
    Task<List<DbData>> FetchDbDataAsync();
    Task<List<CombinedData>> CombineData(List<ApiData> apiData, List<DbData> dbData);
    Task StoreDataAsync(List<CombinedData> combinedData);
}

public class DataService : IDataService
{
    public async Task<List<ApiData>> FetchApiDataAsync()
    {
        // Fetch data from third-party API
        // Simulating an API call
        await Task.Delay(1000); // Simulate delay
        return new List<ApiData>(); // Return some data
    }

    public async Task<List<DbData>> FetchDbDataAsync()
    {
        // Fetch data from the database
        // Simulating a database query
        await Task.Delay(1000); // Simulate delay
        return new List<DbData>(); // Return some data
    }

    public List<CombinedData> CombineData(List<ApiData> apiData, List<DbData> dbData)
    {
        // Combine API and DB data based on a common key
        return apiData.Join(dbData, api => api.Id, db => db.Id, (api, db) => new CombinedData
        {
            Id = api.Id,
            ApiValue = api.Value,
            DbValue = db.Value
        }).ToList();
    }

    public async Task StoreDataAsync(List<CombinedData> combinedData)
    {
        // Store the combined data, for example, in memory cache or database
        await Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}

*** PART 2: 
2. Console App Features and Benefits:
Lightweight: A console application is a very lightweight, standalone solution for periodic data processing without requiring a web server or UI.
Self-contained: The console app can be deployed as a single executable, making it easy to deploy and manage.
Scheduling: By using IHostedService, you can easily schedule tasks to run at fixed intervals (e.g., every 10 minutes or hourly).
Logging: Console apps can log their actions and errors, helping you monitor the data refresh process.

*** PART 3: 
3. When to Use a Console App for This Task:
A console application is ideal for background tasks that do not need a user interface. It's a good fit if:

You're building a scheduled data refresh service that runs periodically without direct interaction from users.
You need to automate data aggregation, combining data from external sources (API and database) and storing it periodically.
The service doesn't need to be always up and running as a web application (e.g., no REST APIs or user-facing components).
Limitations of Console Apps:
If the task involves a web-based API or client interaction (i.e., responding to HTTP requests), then a Web API (ASP.NET Core) might be more appropriate, though you could still host this as a background service within a web application.
UI or Interactivity: Console applications don't have an interactive UI, so if you need a frontend or a dashboard for managing or viewing the data, a web application would be required.
Conclusion:
Yes, based on the scenario and requirements you described, a console application (using IHostedService) could be a great choice for periodically fetching and refreshing data, processing it, and storing or caching the results. This solution would be lightweight, self-contained, and ideal for running background tasks like data refresh without the need for a web server.
-------------------------

******* Related interview questions on above scenario *******  :
1 Question. What is the kind of application that you are building here? Is it an API or UI? What are you building for this purpose?
Answer: In this scenario, the application you're building would not be a typical web API or UI. Instead, you're building a console application that handles background tasks such as data aggregation and periodic refresh.
=> The primary role of this application is to:
Fetch data from multiple sources (a third-party API and a database).
Combine and process that data.
Store the processed data or make it available for use by other services or applications.
This kind of setup is typically a console application that runs in the background and periodically updates the data, without any direct user interaction. You can achieve periodic data refresh using background services like IHostedService in .NET or libraries like Hangfire.

The key point is that, unlike a traditional API that responds to incoming requests from clients, this console application is designed to run periodically on a schedule to refresh data—and its job is to ensure that the data is up-to-date for consumption by other services or systems.

2 Question. If you can’t use Entity Framework, what would be the other option?
Answer: If you cannot use Entity Framework (EF) for data access, you could consider the following alternatives:
ADO.NET: This is the low-level approach for working directly with SQL databases. It provides full control over SQL queries, but lacks the abstraction layer of EF, so you'll need to manually manage connections, queries, and object mapping.
Dapper: A lightweight and high-performance ORM that provides a simple API for executing SQL queries and mapping results to objects. Dapper is often used when performance is a priority, and it’s more lightweight compared to EF.

3 Question. What kind of validations you can think of in this particular scenario?
Answer: In a data loading scenario where you're combining data from an external API and a database, the types of validation you need to focus on include:
1. API Data Validation:
=> Correctness and Format: Ensure that the data from the API is in the correct format (JSON, XML, etc.) and adheres to the expected structure. For example, validate that each field is present, and its type matches the expected format (e.g., a DateTime field is correctly formatted, numbers are valid).
=> Data Completeness: Ensure that the API response is not missing any required data fields (e.g., an API response might be incomplete or corrupted).

2.  Database Data Validation:
Data Consistency: Ensure that the data you are loading from the database is valid and consistent. For example:
Are the records you are pulling up-to-date or are there stale records?
Do the data tables contain all the required information to merge with the API data?
No Duplicates: Ensure that there are no duplicates in the data you pull from the database that would conflict when combined with the API data.
Data Integrity: Ensure that the data in the database is consistent with business logic. For instance, if you are combining data about a user, check if the user data in the database still exists or has been deleted.
Combined Data Validation:

Data Consistency between API and DB: When combining data from both sources, you should ensure that related records from the API and the database are correctly aligned. For example, if the API provides a product_id, you need to make sure that the corresponding product_id exists in the database if you are merging the data.
Foreign Key Checks: While this scenario might not involve inserting data, you may still need to check that foreign key references between the API and database are valid for merging (e.g., if the API returns a CustomerId, make sure that it exists in the database before combining the data).
Data Transformation Validation:

Mapping Data Correctly: When merging or combining the data, ensure that each field from the API is correctly mapped to its corresponding field in the database or the target structure.
Data Type Consistency: Ensure that types are consistent between the data sources. For example, if the API returns a date in string format and the database stores it as DateTime, you'll need to validate that the transformation is performed correctly during the combination.

4 Question. What kind of SQL exceptions are you anticipating here?
In a data loading scenario (rather than insertion or updates), SQL exceptions might still occur during data retrieval from the database. Here are a few relevant exceptions you could anticipate:

Connection Issues:

SqlException: Server not found: This exception can occur if there’s a network issue, incorrect database credentials, or if the database server is down.
SqlException: Timeout expired: This can happen if the query to load data from the database takes too long due to resource constraints or a slow database server.
Data Retrieval Issues:

SqlException: Incorrect syntax near: This would occur if there is an issue with the SQL query you're using to load the data. This can happen if the query is malformed or if the table or field names in the query are incorrect.
SqlException: Invalid object name: If the SQL query references a table or view that doesn’t exist or has been renamed, this exception would occur.
Data Integrity Violations:

Even though this is about data loading, if your process involves querying data with foreign keys or joins and there's an integrity issue (for instance, trying to join data where some key doesn't exist in the database), you might encounter foreign key constraint violations or invalid references.
For example, if you're trying to join a Products table from the API with a Sales table in the database, but a ProductID from the API doesn't exist in the database, it could lead to missing data or inconsistent results, although not necessarily a SQL exception.
Query Timeouts:

SqlException: Timeout expired: If you're pulling large datasets from the database to combine with the API data, this exception can occur if the query takes too long to complete, especially in high-load scenarios.
Deadlocks:

SqlException: Deadlock victim: If the data query is running in an environment with concurrent operations (for example, a query that competes with other processes), you might encounter a deadlock exception. This is less likely in a typical read-only data load but can still happen if you're loading large volumes of data in a shared database environment.

5 Question. You said foreign key exceptions, what kind of foreign key issues can come in this case?
In a data loading scenario, foreign key issues arise mostly during the combination of data from the API and database (rather than during data insertion). Here’s what to watch for:

Missing Foreign Keys:

If you’re merging data from the API with the data in the database and there are foreign key relationships (e.g., OrderID, ProductID, CustomerID), you need to ensure that the foreign key values in the API data exist in the database.
Scenario: The API may return OrderDetails for a customer, but the CustomerID in the API data doesn’t exist in the database. This mismatch will lead to invalid relationships when combining the data.
Orphaned Data:

If you’re retrieving related data from the database, ensure that the data you're combining doesn’t create "orphaned" records. For example, if a record in the API points to a foreign key that no longer exists in the database, you'll end up with incomplete or invalid data.
Scenario: If a ProductID exists in the API data, but that ProductID no longer exists in the Products table in your database, the data combination may not be valid.
Data Consistency between Sources:

There could be foreign key issues if the API data and database don’t align correctly. If the data you load from the database expects certain values (such as ProductID or CustomerID), but the API data provides unexpected or mismatched keys, the combination of data will fail.
Scenario: If you're loading sales data from the database and combining it with product information from the API, ensure that ProductID from both sources matches and corresponds to the correct entity in both places.
Foreign Key Constraints on Queries:

While you might not be inserting or updating data, if your query for combining data involves joining tables or querying based on foreign key constraints, you may encounter foreign key issues during data retrieval if the relationships aren't properly defined in the database.
Foreign Key Cascading (during data refresh):

If you're periodically refreshing data and the API returns data that doesn’t match your current relationships, ensure that you are updating the database correctly if changes are made. In some cases, cascading updates or deletes could affect the data you're trying to load.

6 Question. You said you would design this scenario as an API, I said I probably would want to have it as a periodically refreshed, so just being an API endpoint someone has to call it, How would you achieve periodic refresh with an API?
Answer: To achieve periodic refresh with an API, you could use a background service or background job scheduler that refreshes the data at a specific interval. Here's how you could do it:
Background Service: In .NET, you could use IHostedService to periodically refresh the data in the background without requiring manual API calls.
You can have the API return cached data or data from a database. The actual refresh would happen in the background through a service that periodically calls the external API, combines the data, and updates the cache/database.
The client can call the API for data, and it would always be fresh without waiting for a manual update.
Scheduled Jobs: You could also use tools like Hangfire or Quartz.NET to schedule background tasks within the API to refresh the data periodically.

7 Question. Would it be the right approach to use an API for this particular scenario, because my requirement is to have periodic refresh here?
Answer: While API endpoints are great for handling requests and serving data, using an API endpoint for periodic refresh isn't the most efficient approach because:
APIs are request-driven, so they require someone (or something) to trigger them, and the periodic refresh should ideally happen automatically in the background.
Periodic tasks should ideally run without any external request triggering, which is better handled by background services rather than an API endpoint.
Instead of relying on a manual API call to trigger the refresh, you should decouple the periodic task using a background service or job scheduler (like Hangfire or IHostedService) and have the API serve data from a cache or updated storage.

8 Question. In .Net environment, Visual Studio IDE, What are the templates you see usually? Just before project creation, you happen to choose the template right what are the templates you see at high level?
Answer: In Visual Studio, the common templates you’ll see when creating a .NET project are:

ASP.NET Core Web API: For creating APIs.
ASP.NET Core Web App: For building MVC web applications (with or without a frontend).
Console App: For lightweight console applications, including background services.
Worker Service: A specialized template for background services (ideal for scenarios like yours).
Blazor WebAssembly/Server: For building interactive web UIs.
Class Library: For reusable libraries that can be referenced in other projects.
Azure Functions: For serverless computing (handling event-driven background tasks).
Unit Test Project: For testing libraries (with xUnit, MSTest, or NUnit).

9 Question. Have you developed any kind of Windows applications or console apps that scheduled or kind of stuff or services?
Answer:
Yes, if you've worked on any console applications or Windows services, the experience would involve:

Developing background jobs using the Windows Task Scheduler or IHostedService for .NET.
Implementing scheduled tasks within console applications that run at fixed intervals (e.g., hourly, daily).
Managing **system
