1. General Understanding of Azure App Services
What is Azure App Service, and how does it differ from other Azure compute services like Azure Functions and Virtual Machines?
Azure App Service is a fully managed platform for hosting web applications, RESTful APIs, and mobile backends. It provides scalability, high availability, built-in security, and integration with Azure DevOps and GitHub.

Azure App Service vs. Virtual Machines:
VMs require manual OS and infrastructure management, whereas App Services handle infrastructure automatically.
Azure App Service vs. Azure Functions:
App Services run long-running applications with stateful processing.
Azure Functions are event-driven and serverless, suitable for short-lived processes.
Can you explain the different types of hosting plans available in Azure App Service?
Azure App Service provides different hosting plans:

Free & Shared – Limited resources, good for testing.
Basic – Entry-level, good for small apps with low traffic.
Standard – Autoscaling, custom domains, SSL.
Premium – Advanced scaling, better performance, networking integration.
Isolated (App Service Environment - ASE) – Dedicated environment with private networking.
What is the role of Azure App Service Environment (ASE), and how does it differ from a regular App Service Plan?
Azure App Service Environment (ASE) is a fully isolated and dedicated environment for running App Services with higher security, network isolation, and scaling.

ASE vs. Regular App Service Plan:
ASE runs inside a virtual network (VNet) for secure access.
Supports high workloads with greater control over scaling.
Ideal for enterprises needing compliance, security, and networking control.

2. App Service Deployment
What are the deployment options available for an Azure App Service? Which do you typically prefer?
Azure App Service supports multiple deployment methods:

Azure DevOps Pipelines – Preferred for enterprise CI/CD.
GitHub Actions – Ideal for GitHub-based workflows.
ZIP Deploy / FTP – Quick, manual deployments.
ARM Templates / Terraform – Infrastructure as Code (IaC) deployments.
Azure CLI / PowerShell – Scripted deployments.
Preferred Approach: Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions for automated CI/CD.

How would you automate the deployment of a .NET Core application to Azure App Services using Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines?
Set up Azure Repos (Git) or GitHub as source control.
Create an Azure DevOps Pipeline:
Use a YAML or Classic pipeline.
Build the .NET Core application (dotnet build & dotnet publish).
Create an artifact.
Deploy to Azure App Service:
Use Azure Web App task for deployment.
Configure environment variables and connection strings.
Enable Continuous Deployment (CD):
Auto-trigger deployments on push or PR merges.

3. Scaling and Performance
How do you scale an Azure App Service to handle more traffic or load?
Vertical Scaling: Increase the instance size (CPU, memory). Used for quick fixes.
Horizontal Scaling: Scale out by increasing the number of instances (preferred for distributed workloads).
Considerations:

Traffic patterns (predictable vs. sudden spikes).
Cost vs. Performance trade-offs.
Autoscaling vs. manual scaling.
What are Auto-scaling rules in Azure App Service, and how would you configure them?
Auto-scaling rules adjust resources dynamically based on load.

Metrics-based Scaling:
Scale out/in based on CPU %, Memory %, or Request Count.
Schedule-based Scaling:
Define scaling policies for peak and off-peak hours.
Configuration:

Go to Azure Portal → App Service → Scale Out.
Define rules (e.g., Scale out when CPU > 70% for 5 min).
How can you monitor the performance and health of an application hosted on Azure App Service?
Azure Monitor & Application Insights – Collects logs, telemetry, and application metrics.
Log Analytics – Centralized logging across services.
Kusto Query Language (KQL) – For deep log analysis.
Health Check Endpoint – Configured in App Service for status monitoring.

4. Security and Authentication
What authentication options are available in Azure App Services?
Azure Active Directory (AAD) – Enterprise authentication.
OAuth 2.0 & OpenID Connect – Secure authentication with identity providers.
Managed Identity – Secure access to Azure resources.
How would you secure sensitive data in Azure App Services?
Use Azure Key Vault – Secure secrets like DB connection strings.
App Configuration & Environment Variables – Store secrets securely.
Access Controls (IAM, RBAC) – Restrict access to configuration settings.
Can you explain how to enable and configure custom domains with SSL certificates?
Buy or import an SSL certificate.
Bind it to the custom domain in Azure App Service.
Enable HTTPS only for secure traffic.

5. Troubleshooting and Debugging
What are some tools and approaches for troubleshooting issues in Azure App Service?
Application Insights – Performance monitoring & exceptions tracking.
Azure Diagnostics Logs – Collects event logs, HTTP logs, crash dumps.
Azure Kudu (SCM) – Provides live logs, file access, process explorer.
How do you handle "cold start" performance issues?
Use Always On – Keeps the app warm to avoid delays.
Pre-warmed Instances (Premium Plan) – Ensures instances are ready.
Reduce Startup Overhead – Optimize dependency loading.

6. Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)
How do you set up CI/CD for an Azure App Service?
Use Azure DevOps Pipelines or GitHub Actions.
Set up Build & Release pipeline.
Enable Auto-deployment triggers.
Rollback Strategy – Deploy previous successful build on failure.

7. Configuration and Settings Management
How do you manage application settings and connection strings in Azure App Service?
Application Settings – Stores non-sensitive environment-specific values.
Connection Strings – Stores DB connections securely.
Key Vault Integration – For sensitive data.

8. Integration with Other Azure Services
How would you integrate Azure App Services with Azure SQL Database or Cosmos DB?
Use Managed Identity – Secure authentication.
Azure Private Link & VNet Integration – Secure communication.
Use Retry Policies – Handle transient failures.

9. App Service and Networking
How would you configure Azure App Services to access on-premises resources?
Use Hybrid Connections or VNet Integration.
Configure Azure VPN Gateway for secure access.

10. Disaster Recovery and High Availability
Best practices for high availability and disaster recovery?
Deploy across multiple regions.
Use Traffic Manager for failover.
Backup & Restore strategies.

11. .NET and Cloud Integration
How would you optimize a .NET app running in Azure App Services?
Use Caching (Redis, Memory Cache).
Optimize database queries.
Enable Compression (Gzip, Brotli).
Use async/await for better performance.
